### Key Components
- **sheep-dog-mgmt-maven-plugin**: Management Maven plugin for release coordination
- **Reusable GitHub Actions Workflows**: CI/CD automation workflows for other repositories
- **Container Operations**: Docker and Kubernetes reference commands

### Maven Plugin Provided
- **Plugin**: `sheep-dog-mgmt-maven-plugin:1.15-SNAPSHOT`
- **Purpose**: Release management and version coordination across repositories
- **Usage**: Used by other repositories for standardized release processes

## Operations Commands

### Building This Repository
```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Release Management
```bash
# Run from sheep-dog-mgmt-maven-plugin directory
scripts/install.bat
scripts/release.bat

# Or manually:
mvn clean install
mvn release:prepare release:perform
```

## Ecosystem Coordination Role

### Build Order Position
This repository is **first** in the build order:
1. **sheep-dog-ops** â†’ 2. **sheep-dog-qa** â†’ 3. **sheep-dog-local** â†’ 4. **sheep-dog-cloud**

### Dependencies Provided
- **Management Plugin**: Used by other repositories for release management
- **CI/CD Workflows**: GitHub Actions workflows referenced by other repositories
- **Container Standards**: Reference configurations for Docker and Kubernetes

### Cross-Repository Integration
- **Release Coordination**: Manages version bumps and releases across all repositories
- **Workflow Standardization**: Provides consistent CI/CD patterns
- **Operations Documentation**: Central location for infrastructure commands

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### Workflow Types
1. **Maven Release Workflows**: Run on `main` branch for tagging Maven modules
2. **Deploy Workflows**: Run on `develop` branch for deploying snapshots
3. **Reusable Workflows**: Shared workflow templates for other repositories

### Usage by Other Repositories
Other sheep-dog repositories reference workflows from this repository for:
- Standardized build processes
- Consistent release management
- Automated deployment to GitHub Packages

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
1. **Eclipse IDE**: Required for Maven plugin development
2. **Java 21**: Consistent across all repositories
3. **Maven**: For build and release management
4. **Docker**: For container operations testing

### Testing the Management Plugin
1. Build the plugin: `mvn clean install`
2. Test with other repositories' release processes
3. Verify GitHub Packages deployment

## Working with Container Operations

### Local Development
Use commands from `cheatsheet.txt` for:
- Setting up local development containers
- Testing Kubernetes deployments
- Managing multi-container environments

### Reference Commands
- **Docker**: Basic container lifecycle management
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-service orchestration
- **Kubernetes**: Production deployment patterns
- **Minikube**: Local Kubernetes testing

## Repository-Specific Notes

### Dependencies
- **Build Order**: Must be built first to provide management plugin for other repositories
- **No External Dependencies**: This repository provides foundational tools
- **Plugin Repository**: Uses GitHub Packages at `maven.pkg.github.com/farhan5248/sheep-dog-ops`

### Release Process
